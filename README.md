# berrylogo: a better sequence logo

## Description

A berrylogo is a sequence logo alternative developed by [Charles C.
Berry](http://famprevmed.ucsd.edu/faculty/cberry) for "Selection of
Target Sites for Mobile DNA Integration in the Human Genome"
[[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1664696](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1664696)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1664696/)

Instead of “information content”, the y-axis is the log relative
frequency with respect to the background frequency, generated here from
the gc\_content parameter.

## Usage
    library("devtools")
    install_github("berrylogo","leipzig")
    library("berrylogo")
    freqs<-matrix(data=c(0.25,0.65,0.87,0.92,0.16,0.16,0.04,0.98,0.98,1.00,0.02,0.10,0.10,0.80,0.98,0.91,0.07,0.07,
                 0.11,0.05,0.04,0.00,0.26,0.17,0.00,0.01,0.00,0.00,0.29,0.17,0.01,0.03,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.32,
                 0.53,0.26,0.07,0.02,0.53,0.18,0.96,0.01,0.00,0.00,0.65,0.01,0.89,0.17,0.01,0.09,0.59,0.12,

                 byrow=TRUE,nrow=4,dimnames=list(c('A','C','G','T')))
    p<-berrylogo(freqs,gc_content=.41)
    print(p)
