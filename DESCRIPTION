Description: A berryLogo is a seqLogo alternative developed by Charles C. Berry
    for "Selection of Target Sites for Mobile DNA Integration in the Human
    Genome" <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1664696>. Instead of
    "information content", the y-axis is the log relative frequency with
    respect to the background frequency, generated here from the gc_content
    parameter.
